"""Measure the trust signals a draft pays, and what they cost the writer.

Readers judge credibility by costly signals: details that could be checked,
numbers that could be wrong, commitments that expose the writer. Free
signals (generic praise, safe hedges, uniform confidence) are worthless
precisely because they cost nothing. The accurate human detectors of AI
text (Russell et al. 2025) key on this layer, not on banned words.

These are measurements, not verdicts. A poem scores zero specifics and is
not worse for it; a launch post scoring zero specifics is a finding. The
skill decides what a number means for this genre; this script only counts.

Usage: python3 signals.py <draft> [--json]
