## When the brief is a component, not a page

Before entering the full Design flow, **check scope**. If any of these fire, run the Component-scope flow instead — most day-to-day dev requests are component-shaped, not page-shaped, and the page-level apparatus (macrostructure, hero enrichment, footer archetype, project memory) is wrong for them.

**Component-scope signals:**

- The brief names a single UI element: *a button · an input · a card · a modal · a dropdown · a tooltip · a select · a checkbox · a switch · a tab strip · a chip · a badge · a banner · a snackbar · a popover · a slider · a date picker · an avatar*.
- The brief is short (≤ 30 words) and refers to one element.
- The target file is a single component (e.g., `./Button.tsx`, `./components/Input.css`, `app/components/Card.vue`).
- The user explicitly says *"just the X"*, *"only the Y"*, *"this one element"*, *"a single ___"*.

A single unambiguous component signal is enough when the requested scope contains no page-level work; brief length does not override explicit scope. Multi-section pages and landing-page builds use Design flow. If component and page signals conflict, use the clarification at the end of this file.

### What Component-scope keeps from the page flow

Read the shared definitions in [design-flow.md](design-flow.md): §0 Pre-flight scan, §1 Design-context gate, §2.6 Theme route, and §3 Load the visual ruleset. Apply the component-specific overrides below; do not run the page-only steps listed under “What Component-scope skips”.

For §3, load the chosen genre/theme, universal rules, and conditional references needed by the component. Skip the macrostructure index, page archetypes (hero, section, nav, footer), hero enrichment, and multi-section preview references.

- **Step 0 · Pre-flight scan** — same. Read existing tokens, fonts, framework, microinteraction stance. A button on a Geist-bodied Tailwind project must adopt those tokens, not invent new ones.
- **Step 1 · Genre detection** — same. Editorial / modern-minimal / atmospheric / playful. The component inherits its surroundings' genre (silent default to editorial when unknown).
- **Step 2.6 · Theme route** — same. If a `tokens.css` or `design.md` exists, the component uses those tokens. Otherwise it asks "is there a system to follow, or should I pick one?" — defaulting to *catalog* if the user is silent.
- **2+1 font discipline** — same.
- **State discipline — STRICTER.** Every interactive component MUST ship code for **all 8 states**: default · hover · `:focus-visible` · `:active` · disabled · loading · error · success. The 8-state checklist in [`interaction-and-states.md`](interaction-and-states.md) is mandatory, not advisory.
- **Slop test — universal-only subset.** Run the visual / microinteraction / contrast (gates 40–41) / a11y / typography gates. Skip the diversification gates (no `.hallmark/log.json` entry — components don't rotate) and skip the layout-safety gates that assume a full page.

### What Component-scope skips

- **Step 2 · Macrostructure pick.** Components don't have macrostructures. State this explicitly: *"Component-scope: skipping macrostructure."*
- **Nav and footer archetype picks.** N1a–N13 and Ft1–Ft8 are page-scope only. A component is one element; it has no nav, no footer. Skip both.
- **Hero polish patterns (HP1–HP4).** Page-scope only. A button or card has no hero.
- **Step 4 · Enrichment.** No hero illustration, no demo video, no abstract background. The component IS the artifact.
- **Step 5 · Multi-section preview.** Replaced by the 8-state demo wrapper (below).
- **Project-memory append.** No `.hallmark/log.json` entry for component runs. The diversification rule doesn't apply.

### What Component-scope emits

**Two files, side by side:**

1. **The component artifact** — a single self-contained file matching the project's conventions:
   - React / Vue / Svelte: `Button.tsx` / `Button.vue` / `Button.svelte`
   - Vanilla web: `button.css` + `button.html`
   - Tailwind: a `.tsx` with `className` chains AND a `tokens.css` if missing
   - The component consumes Hallmark tokens by name (`var(--color-accent)`), never inlines OKLCH values.

2. **An 8-state demo wrapper** — `<ComponentName>.preview.html` (or `.preview.tsx`). A small standalone page that renders the component in **all 8 states** stacked vertically, each labelled. The user opens it once, sees the component working, then deletes it. The wrapper is not part of production code. Format:

   ```
   ┌──── Button — 8 states ────────────────────────┐
   │                                                │
   │ default       [ Click me                  ]    │
   │ hover         [ Click me                  ]    │  ← .is-hover forces :hover styling
   │ focus         [ Click me                  ]    │  ← .is-focus forces :focus-visible
   │ active        [ Click me                  ]    │  ← .is-active forces :active
   │ disabled      [ Click me                  ]    │  ← disabled attr
   │ loading       [ ⌛ Working…                ]    │  ← data-state="loading"
   │ error         [ ⚠ Try again               ]    │  ← data-state="error"
   │ success       [ ✓ Saved                   ]    │  ← data-state="success"
   │                                                │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

   Each labelled row uses a class (e.g. `.is-hover`) that the component's CSS targets in addition to the real pseudo-class, so all 8 states render at once on the demo page. Example:

   ```css
   .btn:hover, .btn.is-hover { background: var(--color-paper-3); }
   .btn:focus-visible, .btn.is-focus { outline: 2px solid var(--color-focus); }
   .btn:active, .btn.is-active { transform: translateY(1px); }
   ```

### Stamp format for component output

Components stamp differently from pages:

```css
/* Hallmark · component: <type> · genre: <genre> · theme: <theme>
 * states: default · hover · focus · active · disabled · loading · error · success
 * contrast: pass (46–50)
 */
```

The `component:` prefix tells future Hallmark runs this artifact is component-scoped and shouldn't trigger page-level diversification rules. The `states:` line is a checklist — every state listed must have actual styling in the file.

### When in doubt — ask once

If the brief is ambiguous between component and page (e.g. *"design a pricing section"* — could be one card, could be a whole page), ask one short question: *"One pricing card, or the whole pricing page?"* Default to **component** if the user doesn't engage — single-artifact output is cheaper to redirect than a multi-section page.
