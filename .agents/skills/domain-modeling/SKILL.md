# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* the Glossary for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

```
/
├── AGENTS.md          ← `## Glossary` section is the glossary
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

The glossary lives in `AGENTS.md` because it is the one file every session reads unconditionally; a separate glossary file would only be read when someone remembers to. Create things lazily: add the `## Glossary` section when the first term is resolved, create `docs/adr/` when the first ADR is needed. If `AGENTS.md` itself does not exist, create it at the repo root.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in the Glossary, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update the Glossary inline

When a term is resolved, update the `## Glossary` section of `AGENTS.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the term format in [references/glossary-format.md](references/glossary-format.md).

The Glossary should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat it as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else. Other sections of `AGENTS.md` are not touched by this skill.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [references/adr-format.md](references/adr-format.md).
